    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup colored decorating sugar</li>
      <li>⅔ cup shortening</li>
      <li>⅔ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place decorating
        sugar in a small bowl (or use several colors and separate bowls).
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat shortening and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth and
        creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in sugar until incorporated, then mix in
        eggs, one at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Mix in
        vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl until combined.
        Gradually add to the wet ingredients and mix until incorporated and the
        dough comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in sugar to coat,
        then place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until light brown on the bottoms, 10 to 12
        minutes, switching racks halfway through. Remove from the oven and
        transfer to wire racks to cool.
      </li>
    </ol>
