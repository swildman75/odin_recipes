    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ pound ground veal</li>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>
      Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Mix in cheese, eggs, garlic,
      parsley, salt, and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add bread crumbs and slowly mix in water, 1/2 cup at a time, until mixture
      is moist but still holds its shape (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of
      water); shape into meatballs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat olive oil in a large skillet; add meatballs in batches and cook until
      browned on all sides, slightly crisp, and cooked through, about 10 to 15
      minutes. Drain on paper towels.
